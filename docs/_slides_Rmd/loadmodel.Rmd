## Load a NetLogo model

Find the Wolf Sheep model file (with extension ".nlogo") in the Models Library, and save the full path to a variable.

```{r, title = "{{ site.handouts[0] }}"}
model_path <- file.path("models", "Sample Models",
  "Biology", "Wolf Sheep Predation.nlogo")
```

Load the model with `NLLoadModel()` by joining the NetLogo prefix to the model path.

```{r, title = "{{ site.handouts[0] }}"}
NLLoadModel(file.path(nl_path, model_path)) 
```
