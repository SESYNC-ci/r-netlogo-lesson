## Load a NetLogo model

Find the Wolf Sheep model file (with extension ".nlogo") in the Models Library, and save the full path to a variable.

```{r}
model_path <- file.path("models", "Sample Models", "Biology","Wolf Sheep Predation.nlogo")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
if (Sys.info()['sysname'] == 'Darwin') {
  nl_path <- "~/Applications/NetLogo 5.3.1"
}
```

Load the model with `NLLoadModel()` by joining the NetLogo prefix to the model path.

```{r}
NLLoadModel(file.path(nl_path, model_path))
```
