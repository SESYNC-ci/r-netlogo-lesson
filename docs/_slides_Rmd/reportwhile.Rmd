## Report While

Instead of specifying a given number of iterations, you can use the results of a NetLogo reporter to only repeat executing commands while a reporter returns `TRUE` using `NLDoReportWhile()`. 
  
```{r, title = "{{ site.handouts[0] }}"}
NLCommand("setup")
sim_results <- NLDoReportWhile(condition = "any? wolves", 
                               command = "go",
                               reporter = c("ticks", "count sheep", "count wolves"),
                               as.data.frame = TRUE,
                               df.col.names = c("tick", "sheep", "wolves"))
```

```{r}
head(sim_results)
```
