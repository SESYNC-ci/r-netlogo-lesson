## Patches

Access information about patches using `NLGetPatches()`. Specify the variable of interest and which patches you are interested in. 

Find the color `("pcolor")` of the central patch (0, 0) using:

```{r}
NLGetPatches(patch.var = c("pxcor", "pycor", "pcolor"),
             patchset = "patches with [pxcor = 0 and pycor = 0]")
# use NLSetPatches()
```

===

Set patch variables using `NLSetPatches()`. Specify the patch variable and a matrix with the same dimensions as your NetLogo world. 

```{r}
NLSetPatches(patch.var = "pcolor", 
             in.matrix = matrix(35, nrow = 51, ncol = 51))

```
