The default output of `NLDoReport()` is an R list, or you can specify that the output should be a data frame with columns named in the `df.col.names` argument. You can use vector of strings to get the results of multiple NetLogo reporters. 

```{r}
sheep_count <- NLDoReport(iterations = 100, 
                          command = "go", 
                          reporter = c("count sheep", "count wolves"),
                          as.data.frame = TRUE,
                          df.col.names = c("sheep", "wolves"))
head(sheep_count)
```
