Execute commands in NetLogo using `NLCommand()`.

```{r}
NLCommand("setup")             # call the setup routine 
NLCommand("go")                # launch the model from R
```

Repeat commands using `NLDoCommand()` and specifying a number of iterations. 

```{r}
NLDoCommand(iterations = 200, "go")
```

It is possible to submit more than one command at once and in combination with R variables. Remember to use "setup" after changing model parameters

```{r}
init_sheep <- 50
NLCommand("set initial-number-sheep ", init_sheep, "setup")
```
