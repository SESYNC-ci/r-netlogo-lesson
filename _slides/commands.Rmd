Execute commands in NetLogo using `NLCommand()`.

```{r}
NLCommand("setup")             # call the setup routine 
NLCommand("go")                # launch the model from R
```

Repeat commands using `NLDoCommand()` and specifying a number of iterations. 

```{r}
NLDoCommand(iterations = 200, "go")
```
