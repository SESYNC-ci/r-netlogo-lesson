## The Console

The interpreter accepts R commands interactively through the console. Basic math, as you would type it on a calculator, is usually a valid command in the R language:

```{r}
1 + 2
```

```{r}
5/3
```

```{r}
4^2
```

<!--split-->

Question
: Why is the output prefixed by `[1]`?

Answer
: {:.fragment} That's the index, or position in a vector, of the first result.

<!--split-->

A command giving a vector of results shows this clearly:

```{r}
seq(1, 100)
```

Rather than basic math, we used a **function** called `seq()` in this command.
Most of "learning R" involves getting to know a whole lot of functions, what are their arguments (a.k.a. inputs) and what do they return (a.k.a. output).

<!--split-->

One thing you'll regularly want to do is store output of a function to a variable.
Using the symbol `<-` is referred to as assignment: we assign to a **variable** on the left of the `<-` symbol the output of what is on its right.

```{r}
x <- seq(1, 100)
```

You'll notice that nothing prints to the console, because we assigned the output to a variable.
We can print `x` by evaluating it by itself.

```{r}
x
```

<!--split-->

Commands must always reference things known to the interpreter.
When you start a R session, there are many things already known, including

- any number
- any string of characters
- functions in `base R`

<!--split-->

To reference a number or function you just type it in as above, but to referece a string of alpha-numeric characters you must surround them in quotation marks.

```{r}
'ab#45'
```

Question
: Is it better to use `'` or `"`?

Answer
: {:.fragment} There is no answer! You will often encounter stylistic choices like this, so if you don't have a personal preference try to mimic existing styles.

<!--split-->

Without quotes, the interpreter checks for things named `abc45.q` and doesn't find anything:

```{r}
ab#45
```

<!--split-->

Anything you assign to a variable becomes known to R, so you can reference it in any command.

```{r}
y <- 'ab#45'
typeof(y)
```
