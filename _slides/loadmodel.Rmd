Load a model (file extension .nlogo) with `NLLoadModel()` by specifying the location of the file. 

NetLogo comes with a collection of sample models including "Fire.nlogo". 
  
```{r}
model.path <- file.path("models", "Sample Models", "Earth Science","Fire.nlogo")
NLLoadModel(file.path(nl.path, model.path))
```
