Use `NLReport()` to get a value or list of values.

```{r}
NLReport("ticks")
NLReport("count sheep")
```

Or use `NLDoReport()` to repeat a command and reporter a defined number of times. This function is like a combination of `NLReport()` and `NLDoCommand()`.

```{r}
NLDoReport(iterations = 5, command = "go", reporter = "count sheep")
```
