Use `NLReport()` to get a value or list of values.

```{r}
NLReport("ticks")
NLReport("count sheep")
```

Or use `NLDoReport()` to repeat a command and reporter a defined number of times. This function is like a combination of `NLReport()` and `NLDoCommand()`.

```{r}
NLDoReport(iterations = 5, command = "go", reporter = "count sheep")
```

The default output of `NLDoReport()` is an R list, or you can specify that the output should be a data frame with columns named in the `df.col.names` argument. You can use vector of strings to get the results of multiple NetLogo reporters. 

```{r}
sheep_count <- NLDoReport(iterations = 100, 
                          command = "go", 
                          reporter = c("count sheep", "count wolves"),
                          as.data.frame = TRUE,
                          df.col.names = c("sheep", "wolves"))
```
