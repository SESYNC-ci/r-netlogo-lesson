## Modes

Create an instance of RNetLogo using `NLStart()`. Use the `gui =` argument to control which mode to operate in. 


```{r}
NLStart(nl.path, gui = FALSE)
```


| Mode | Control in R | Control in NetLogo | Multiple NetLogo sessions |
|------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| GUI (default) | yes | yes | no |
| Headless | yes | no | yes |


Quit a session using `NLQuit()`. Note that if you are running in GUI mode and quit, you will only be able to start NetLogo in a new R session.
